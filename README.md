Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.


## Build and Run:
```bash

cd 2017 # Or year of choice
make -j 4

# or to build a specific example

make AOC_NN 
./AOC_NN

# cin is used if a larger input is needed:

./AOC_NN < InputFile.txt
```

Input files are not saved and must be downloaded from [adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/).
